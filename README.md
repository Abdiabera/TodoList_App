This project is one of the most helpful tools I’ve developed — a full-featured to-do list application. I built it using Swift for iOS, implementing Firebase
for real-time database support and authentication, and structured the app using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to keep the code clean and maintainable. 
The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks seamlessly while syncing data across devices instantly. I can’t wait for everyone to start using it and 
see how it can help organize their daily lives more efficiently.
